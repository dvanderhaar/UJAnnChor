The sample clips contain clipped sequences of single or multiple occurrences of the same action class. 

The pdf Annotation Guide clearly indicates the start and end frames for each class. The sample clips do not necessarily start and end at the exact specified temporal points as specified in the Guide and do not represent how annotations were done. The cips are rather provided to give users an idea of what the actions or a series of the actions look like.

Here is a description for each clip and how it aligns with the way annotations were done:
