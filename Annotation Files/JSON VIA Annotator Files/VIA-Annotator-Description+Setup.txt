VIA Video Annotator

To download the VIA video annotator, please download the html annotator from the link below:
https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/

We provide a template project called:
"AnnChorTemplate.json" which was used as a basis project with the necessary temporal classes loaded.
The only thing that one needs to load into this project is the ballet videos you wish to annotate.
